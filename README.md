# Iris Decision Tree Model

This repository contains code for building and analyzing a Decision Tree model on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, often used for classification tasks. This project demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree algorithm to classify iris species based on flower measurements.
